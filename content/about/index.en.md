During my graduate studies, I focused on research in **Computer Vision**. During that time, I accumulated many ideas and notes, gradually developing the habit of documenting my learning process and thought flow.

I later spent a semester as an exchange student at **Technical University of Munich (TUM)** in Germany. While it was officially an academic exchange, my goal was to travel, explore different countries, and broaden my perspective. During my time in Germany, I not only filmed [travel vlogs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjX4nmQ6O9wAjDsIIcJjntjKSk-WvSdlz&si=r_vilNwFYmiiHU2n) but also documented my exchange experience and reflections in writing.

I am currently working as a **Digital Design Engineer** at **MediaTek**. Hoping to continue learning and improving outside of work—and to share that process—I created this website, with the intention of writing consistently over the long term.

I see this website as a starting point for everything: a place to look back on the past and to look ahead to the future. The content here spans technical tools, note-taking practices, and workflows, as well as learning records from different stages of my life. These notes may not be complete, nor do they always lead to clear conclusions; they are simply my attempts to organize and understand the things I encounter at different moments in time.
