## 1. What Is a Domain Name?

If we compare a website to a house, **then a domain name is like your home address**.

Its purpose is to replace hard-to-remember IP addresses with something more human-friendly, so users can find your website (house) more easily.

For example, computers communicate using IP addresses (such as `142.250.72.206`), which are not intuitive for humans. That’s why domain names like `example.com` exist.

The **DNS (Domain Name System)** mentioned later is responsible for the following task:

> Converting the domain name you enter into an IP address that computers can actually understand.

Before configuring a custom domain, a website hosted on GitHub Pages will have a default URL like this:

```
https://<username>.github.io
```

As soon as you see this URL, you know the site is hosted on GitHub Pages.

Once you have your own domain name, the URL becomes:

```
https://example.com
```

Not only does this look cleaner, it also feels much more like “your own” website.

### Domain Hierarchy Basics

A complete domain name can usually be broken down into the following levels:

| **Level**                 | **Example**                  | **Description**                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Top-Level Domain (TLD)    | `.com`, `.io`, `.org`, `.tw` | The rightmost part of a domain, indicating its type or region                                     |
| Second-Level Domain (SLD) | `example.com`(`example`)     | The actual domain name you purchase and own; the main identifier of the site                      |
| Subdomain                 | `www.example.com`(`www`)     | An extension built on top of the second-level domain, often used to separate services or purposes |

As you can see, **domain names are extended by adding prefixes to the left**, while the top-level domain on the far right serves as the starting point of the entire structure.

### Why Use Your Own Domain Name?

Setting up a custom domain usually has several practical benefits:

- **More professional and recognizable**
    - A personal website, technical blog, or portfolio no longer looks tied to a specific platform
- **Decoupled from the hosting provider**
    - The URL belongs to you, not GitHub; even if you switch hosting platforms later, the URL does not need to change
- **Better for long-term operation**
    - Helps accumulate SEO value and makes sharing easier, such as using the link on business cards or resumes

## 2. Buying Your Own Domain with Namecheap

> This part requires a small purchase. A domain usually costs a few hundred TWD per year, which works out to just a few dozen per month. For a clean, personal URL, I think it’s worth it.

First, go to the [Namecheap website](https://www.namecheap.com/) and search for a domain name you like. Other large domain registrars include [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en) and [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en-US); the choice mainly comes down to personal preference.

You’ll see results like the following:

If the domain is available, you’ll see **Add to cart**. Different top-level domains have different prices; commonly chosen ones include `.com`, `.io`, `.net`, and `.me`.

Next, proceed through the registration and checkout process. You can leave **AUTO-RENEW** enabled to avoid forgetting to renew the domain after one year. At this stage, there is **no need to purchase an additional SSL certificate**, as GitHub Pages will automatically provide and configure HTTPS later.

> [!info] What is SSL?
> SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is an encryption technology that secures data transmission between users and websites, preventing eavesdropping or tampering. Once enabled, a site switches from HTTP to HTTPS.

After a successful purchase, you’ll receive an order confirmation email:

![](assets/index/file-20251230223006342-e589299b-3df9-4f8a-a84a-f75bfd68c89e.png)

Don’t forget to click the verification link in the other email you receive:

## 3. Configuring DNS on Namecheap

Next, we’ll configure DNS so that the domain name you enter can be correctly translated into an IP address.

Go to `Account` → `Dashboard`:

![](assets/index/file-20251230223331528-cb7c75b2-358c-4be9-8780-275759fcd626.png)

Find the domain you just purchased and click `MANAGE`:

On the `Domain` page, select `Namecheap BasicDNS`:

![](assets/index/file-20251231180222643-6ed45616-97b8-4e63-962c-7e1f59bd3d50.png)

Switch to the `Advanced DNS` tab and add **A Records** using the following four IP addresses:

```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

![](assets/index/file-20251230223836201-257afe8f-7ad9-4d36-a599-f15d7e2457a4.png)

These are the official IP addresses used by GitHub Pages. By configuring them, you are pointing your domain to where GitHub Pages hosts your site.

Next, add a **CNAME Record** as shown below. For the `Value`, enter `<username>.github.io`, which was configured in the previous article.

![](assets/index/file-20251231181255529-b8388cb4-f7ca-4cd6-b62e-303ffe2f31ac.png)

> [!NOTE] What’s the difference between an A Record and a CNAME?
> The **A Record** handles the apex domain (`weiweifan.com`), while the **CNAME** handles subdomains (`www.weiweifan.com`), allowing both to point to the same GitHub Pages site.

## 4. Setting a Custom Domain on GitHub Pages

We’re almost there. GitHub Pages provides built-in support for custom domains, and we just need to configure it.

First, go back to your local project and edit `hugo.toml` (if you followed the setup from previous articles, the file will be under `config/_default/`; with the default structure, it’s in the project root). Update the `baseURL` to your own domain:

```toml
baseURL = "https://weiweifan.com/"
```

Push the change to GitHub:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "update baseURL to https://weiweifan.com/"
git push
```

Back on GitHub, go to your `<username>.github.io` repository → `Settings` → `Pages`. Enter your domain name under **Custom domain**, then click `Save`.

![](assets/index/file-20251230224922307-6cdd8b8e-5782-4170-96fc-3b8facd4315c.png)

Wait for the DNS check to complete (this usually takes only a few minutes):

![](assets/index/file-20251230225028712-cfbf2665-039a-4327-99ce-a112a93951c3.png)

Once the check passes:

![](assets/index/file-20251230225046033-9ac15fcf-7b9a-4a26-9da2-a6d4d720bed4.png)

Then enable **Enforce HTTPS**. GitHub Pages will automatically request a free SSL certificate from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), so no manual configuration is required. If the option is temporarily unavailable, refresh the page and try again. If it still doesn’t work, clear the **Custom domain** field, re-enter it, and wait a bit longer.

![](assets/index/file-20251230225104613-90cd05df-2bae-461a-bc04-49e6bb521963.png)

After everything is set up, visit https://weiweifan.com to confirm that the site loads correctly. You can also check https://www.weiweifan.com — both URLs should work.

![](assets/index/file-20251231183549781-8536c5a4-bedc-4beb-978c-507e0f5e86c9.png)

At this point, you can take a short break. As long as the domain itself does not change, switching hosting platforms later usually won’t immediately erase the SEO value you’ve already accumulated.
